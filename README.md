# PCA
## We conducted analysis on major drivers of price chanages in Cryptos. 
In order to use a diverse portfolio, we included major cryptos as wells as cryptos of Defi, NFT and Metaverse in our PCA. Please find the coins we used listed as follows: 
Bitcoin (BTC), Solana(SOL), Polygon (Matic), Ethereum (ETH), XRP(XRP), Dogecoin(DOGE), Cardano(AdA), TRON(TRX), Litecoin (LTC), Uniswap(UNI), Avalanche (AVAX), Chainlink (LINK), Internet Computer (ICP), Apecoin (APE), Decentraland (MANA), Theta Network (THETA), Stacks (STX), Polkadot (DOT), Sushi swap (SUSHI), Gold (GLD), USD (DX-Y.NYB)

We anticipated that the crypto market performs differently during the bull run (Data from 2021/5/10-2021/12/31) vs the winter (Data from 2022/1/3-present). We ran PCA over two different periods to see whether common drivers of cryptos behave differently during different periods. 

To choose an appropriate number of factors to use, we created scree plots for both time periods. Then, we chose the elbow accordingly and used 2 factors for our PCA.
